# `blog init`

Hi there, I'm Brad.

I am a command line inhabitant passionate about software delivery correctness, efficiency and automation, system and app architecture, all in the context of cloud tech and Kubernetes.

I plan to use this blog to write about my labs, things that interest me, challenge me, or unique projects where Google didn't help much.

Expect to see posts about Kubernetes, .NET, Azure, Unity, vim, Linux and perhaps some gaming bits.
